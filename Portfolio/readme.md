In between skills and projects, Implement another site that will lead to the horizontal timeline of all relevant experience. Or maybe just have it built into the site itself. we'll see.
    More on the horizontal timeline, I think this is going to be really cool, but difficult to animate correctly.
    Things to take into consideration:
        1. For the mobile, we are going to have to make it only one sided, and the bar is going to have to move relative to the timeframes. Meaning, if there is a ton of stuff going on in march, and not much in april, it is going to have to scoll "slower" in march and "faster" in april. (Not sure, but maybe also only use the more major details to prevent the user from scrolling too much)
        2. For the desktop, this will be double sided, and will have the things pop up above and below, and also have two or three avalible for each side. Doing this will be difficult, but can be beneficial. That also brings having to align a bar to each on the timeline, to it has to adjust.
    They are going to have an animation in, and an animation out. We will figure this one out when it's closer to being finished. The bar (thats connecting the information to the timeline) is going to have to abjust, so it looks smooth, easy to read, and is somewhat accurate.
    there are only going to be as many informational blocks as the window can handle, and each time it goes in and comes out, the information on it is going to change, but the background to the information won't.
Third are my projects. These will be all just there until there are too many and something needs to be sorted or organized
Fourth is my Accomplishments. This is like getting 1st for BPA or something similar.
Finally, the ending is the Contact me.
