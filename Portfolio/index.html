            <p>My name is Isaac and I'm a high school student with a passion for problem-solving and creating solutions through coding. My journey in programming began with C++ beacuse it was the only language that I knew of at the time. I relished the challenge it presented and felt a great sense of accomplishment in overcoming its complexities.</p>
            <p>Over time, my interests branched out into Python, a language that shares many similarities to english. It was through Python that I discovered the fascinating field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The blend of math, data, and programming was something that instantly captivated me. The idea of creating algorithms capable of 'learning' and improving over time was awe-inspiring. I have since been immersing myself in the realm of machine learning, exploring different models and frameworks, and undertaking various projects.</p>
            <p>Although I also have some experience with front-end languages such as HTML/CSS and Java, my primary love lies in back-end development and data science. I enjoy the thrill of solving complex problems, of looking at a dataset and untangling its secrets, and the satisfaction of a well-optimized algorithm.</p>
            <p>I'm eager to learn more, to dive deeper into this fascinating field, and to gain real-world experience. This is why I'm actively seeking an internship in machine learning, to not only utilize the skills I've gained thus far but to continually grow and challenge myself in a professional setting.</p>
            <p>Thank you for taking the time to peruse my portfolio. I'm excited about the future and the potential opportunities to contribute to the ever-evolving field of machine learning and AI.</p>
